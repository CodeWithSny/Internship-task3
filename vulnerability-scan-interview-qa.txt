Interview Questions and Answers - Vulnerability Scanning

1. What is vulnerability scanning?
Answer: Vulnerability scanning is the process of automatically detecting known security weaknesses, misconfigurations, or outdated software in a system or network using specialized tools.

2. What is the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
Answer:
- Vulnerability Scanning: Automated, identifies known vulnerabilities, less intrusive, and used regularly.
- Penetration Testing: Manual or semi-automated, simulates real-world attacks, more intrusive, and used for deep security evaluation.

3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?
Answer:
- Outdated operating system or software
- Weak or reused passwords
- Open or unnecessary ports
- Disabled antivirus/firewall
- Insecure browser plugins

4. How do vulnerability scanners detect vulnerabilities?
Answer: Scanners analyze system configurations, open ports, software versions, and compare them against a database of known vulnerabilities (like CVE entries) using rules, signatures, and fingerprinting.

5. What is CVSS?
Answer: CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standardized method for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities on a scale from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate more critical vulnerabilities.

6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?
Answer: 
- For personal systems: At least once a month or after major software changes.
- For business environments: Weekly or after major network changes or patch updates.

7. What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?
Answer: A false positive occurs when the scanner reports a vulnerability that doesn’t actually exist or isn’t exploitable in the given environment.

8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?
Answer:
- Based on CVSS score: Critical (9.0–10.0), High (7.0–8.9), Medium (4.0–6.9), Low (0.1–3.9)
- Whether the vulnerability is exploitable
- If public exploits are available
- Importance and exposure of the affected system (e.g., internet-facing vs internal)
